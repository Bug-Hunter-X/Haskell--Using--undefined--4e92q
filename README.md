# Haskell Undefined Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell: using the `undefined` value.  `undefined` represents a value that has not been defined, and attempting to use it will result in a runtime exception.

The `bug.hs` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.hs` file shows how to avoid this error by providing a concrete value or handling potential undefined cases.
