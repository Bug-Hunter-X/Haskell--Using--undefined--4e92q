```haskell
main = do
  let x = 10  -- Replace undefined with a concrete value
  print x
```

**Alternative Solution (using Maybe):**
If the value might be truly undefined under certain circumstances, you can use the `Maybe` type to represent the possibility of absence.

```haskell
main = do
  let x = Just 10 -- Or Nothing if the value is not available
  case x of
    Just val -> print val
    Nothing -> print "Value is undefined"
```
